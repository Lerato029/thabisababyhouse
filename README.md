## `System Architectre`

Node and React are used for the  backend and frontend respectively as they both use Javascript thus making the development process easier and 
MongoDB will be used for the API as it is cloud-based, scalable, and flexible. Next.js will be used to take advantage of the power of React while providing pages that will be rendered on the server and load faster to provide users with a pleasing experience on the dynamic site. 
Next.js also provides SEO (Search Engine Optimization) ready sites to increase the visibility of the website on relevant searches ease in deployment with Vercel. Bootstrap will be used due to its responsive and beautiful templates.

## `System Requirements`

The Thabisa Baby House website is a platform to allow the baby house to manage its funding scheme and a platform for volunteers, donors, and the general public to be informed on how they can contribute to supporting abandoned babies during their journey towards finding permanent homes.
 It is based on the current website (found at: http://thabisababyhouse.co.za/ )  for the baby house which is currently static and in need of a revamp. It will allow ease for the admin in editing, updating donation packages, and managing donors and volunteers. 
Users wonâ€™t be just given the opportunity to read the information on the website but will be given opportunities to sign up and become members who can either purchase merchandise sold by the baby house, donate or sign up for volunteering. The WWF website (found at: https://www.worldwildlife.org/ ) has similar functionality as users are able to log in to an account, donate or purchase adopt packages and merchandise to contribute towards the conservation of wildlife.

#### Non-Functional Requirements

The non-functional requirements are as follows:

 * Data such as purchases, account details, and any other information on the website will be stored on a database.
 * The website should be easy to use and cater to different types of users.
 * The website should be easily deployed.
