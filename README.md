## `System Architectre`

Node and React are used for the  backend and frontend respectively as they both use Javascript thus making the development process easier and 
MongoDB will be used for the API as it is cloud-based, scalable, and flexible. Next.js will be used to take advantage of the power of React while providing pages that will be rendered on the server and load faster to provide users with a pleasing experience on the dynamic site. 
Next.js also provides SEO (Search Engine Optimization) ready sites to increase the visibility of the website on relevant searches ease in deployment with Vercel. Bootstrap will be used due to its responsive and beautiful templates.

## `System Requirements`

The Thabisa Baby House website is a platform to allow the baby house to manage its funding scheme and a platform for volunteers, donors, and the general public to be informed on how they can contribute to supporting abandoned babies during their journey towards finding permanent homes.

Users wonâ€™t be just given the opportunity to read the information on the website but will be given opportunities to sign up and become members who can either purchase merchandise sold by the baby house, donate or sign up for volunteering. The WWF website (found at: https://www.worldwildlife.org/ ) has similar functionality as users are able to log in to an account, donate or purchase adopt packages and merchandise to contribute towards the conservation of wildlife.

<a name="security"/>  

## `Security`
the structure of the application allows for safety of sensitive information and API keys which have been hidden in the .env.local file as shown in the config files above. For environment variables needed to be exposed to the browser NEXT_PUBLIC is appended to the beginning of the key.

#### Hashing
passwords are not just saved in their raw state but are hashed with bcrypt for better security.

#### JSON WEB Tokens
Tokens generated with jwt to authenticate users in the auth middlware function.


<a name="deployment"/>  

## `Deployment`
Since the application was created with Next.js which serves pages rendered from the server-side the client and server were deployed together using [Vercel(https://vercel.com) who happen to be the creators of Next.js and provid ease in adding environment variables on deployment.
Link to deployed app can be found [here](https://thabisa-baby-house.vercel.app/)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
